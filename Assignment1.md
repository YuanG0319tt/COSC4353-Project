# COSC4353-Project
Description

In this assignment we will come up with initial design for a software application that you will build in this semester. We will not be writing any code in this assignment, but only looking at some initial design ideas and high-level design.

Problem Statement

A non-profit organization has requested to build a software application that will help manage and optimize their volunteer activities. The application should help the organization efficiently allocate volunteers to different events and tasks based on their preferences, skills, and availability. The application should consider the following criteria:

Volunteer’s location
Volunteer’s skills and preferences
Volunteer’s availability
Event requirements and location
Task urgency and priority
The software must include the following components:

Login (Allow volunteers and administrators to register if not already registered)
User Registration (Initially only username and password, followed by email verification)
User Profile Management (After registration, users should log in to complete their profile, including location, skills, preferences, and availability)
Event Management (Administrators can create and manage events, specifying required skills, location, and urgency)
Volunteer Matching (A module that matches volunteers to events/tasks based on their profiles and the event requirements)
Notification System (Send notifications to volunteers for event assignments, updates, and reminders)
Volunteer History (Track volunteer participation history and performance)
NOTE: Students are free to choose between creating a web application or a mobile application using any tools and technologies they prefer.

Answer these questions:

Initial Thoughts (2 points)
Discuss your initial thoughts in detail on how you will design this application.
Development Methodology (2 points)
Discuss which development methodology you will use and why.
High-Level Design / Architecture (6 points)
Provide a high-level design or architecture of the solution you are proposing.
Guidelines for the Questions:
Initial Thoughts

Consider user experience: How will users (volunteers and administrators) interact with the application?
Identify the key functionalities: What are the essential features the application must have?
Technology stack: What technologies might you use for front-end, back-end, database, and other components?
Development Methodology

Explain why you would choose a particular development methodology (e.g., Agile, Waterfall, DevOps).
Discuss how this methodology will help manage the project effectively.
High-Level Design / Architecture

Create a diagram to illustrate the overall structure of your application.
Identify the main components (e.g., front-end, back-end, database).
Describe how these components will interact with each other.
Mention any third-party services or APIs you plan to integrate.
