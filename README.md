Welcome to the Volunteer Management System! This system is designed to help organizations manage volunteer activities efficiently. It includes features like event creation, volunteer matching, and tracking volunteer participation history.

## Why "Naba"?
"Naba" is derived from the Arabic word meaning "good news" or "announcement." We chose this name because our system is designed to bring positive change by connecting volunteers with meaningful opportunities. Just as "Naba" signifies an important message, our platform serves as a crucial link between organizations and volunteers, making a lasting impact in communities.
